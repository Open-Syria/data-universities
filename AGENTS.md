# AGENTS.md

This file is the repo-root guide for coding agents working on the OpenSyria
university dataset. Treat it as the agent-facing companion to `README.md`: read
it before changing files, then read the closest nested `AGENTS.md` if one exists
for the paths you touch.

This repository contains the canonical OpenSyria university datasets.

Work inside this repository only. Keep canonical data under `data`, schemas under `schemas`, imports under `imports`, examples and fixtures in their existing folders, and automation in `scripts`. Do not commit local secrets, generated scratch files, or unrelated artifacts.

Use Node 24+ and pnpm 11+. Before handing off changes, run the smallest relevant command and prefer `pnpm validate` when data, schemas, imports, reports, or release output behavior changed:

- `pnpm check`
- `pnpm validate:schemas`
- `pnpm validate:imports`
- `pnpm validate:data`
- `pnpm validate`

## Local Skill Selection

Repo-local skills live in `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. When a task
matches a skill below, read that `SKILL.md` before editing. Prefer the most
specific skill that covers the task, and combine skills only when the work spans
multiple areas.

Data-only edits to canonical JSON usually do not need a local skill unless they
also change validation rules, import behavior, reports, or release automation.
Schema and script changes should use the relevant skill before editing.

Use these local skills as follows:

- `nodejs-backend-patterns`: use when adding or changing Node scripts that behave like backend services, API clients, import pipelines, release publishers, or long-running automation with error handling and external integrations.
- `nodejs-best-practices`: use when making general Node.js architecture decisions, changing async control flow, handling files/processes, improving security, or choosing between implementation patterns in scripts.
- `zod`: use when defining or refactoring schemas, validators, `safeParse` flows, inferred types, or validation error handling for university records and fixtures.

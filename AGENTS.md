# AGENTS.md

This file is the repo-root guide for coding agents working on the OpenSyria
university dataset. Treat it as the agent-facing companion to `README.md`: read
it before changing files, then read the closest nested `AGENTS.md` if one exists
for the paths you touch.

This repository contains the canonical OpenSyria university datasets.

Work inside this repository only. Keep canonical data under `data`, schemas under `schemas`, imports under `imports`, examples and fixtures in their existing folders, and automation in `scripts`. Do not commit local secrets, generated scratch files, or unrelated artifacts.

Use Node 24+ and pnpm 11+. Before handing off changes, run the smallest relevant command and prefer `pnpm validate` when data, schemas, imports, reports, or release output behavior changed:

- `pnpm check`
- `pnpm validate:schemas`
- `pnpm validate:imports`
- `pnpm validate:data`
- `pnpm validate`

## Documentation Freshness

- Treat this `AGENTS.md` as living agent documentation. When adding, removing, or renaming a repo-local skill under `.agents/skills`, update the `Local Skill Selection` list in this file in the same change.
- When changing dataset scope, repository layout, commands, release artifacts, contributor-facing workflow, or public documentation links, update `README.md`, `contributions/README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` when the change is release-visible.
- When changing canonical record shapes in `data/*.json` or schema files in `schemas/*.schema.json`, update `docs/DATA_SCHEMA.md`, `docs/FIELD_REFERENCE.md`, `docs/ID_POLICY.md`, `schemas/README.md`, and validation examples/tests in the same change.
- When adding, removing, or reclassifying sources, source fields, source licenses, source access dates, rankings providers, logo/image sources, or source decision rationale, update `data/sources.json`, `docs/SOURCES.md`, `docs/SOURCE_DECISIONS.md`, import manifests, and any affected source references in canonical records.
- When changing import inputs, normalized outputs, source manifests, import retention policy, or importer scripts, update `imports/README.md`, `imports/manifests/README.md`, `docs/IMPORT_WORKFLOW.md`, `docs/PRE_SEED_CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/SEED_PLAN.md`, and the relevant `docs/post-seed/*.md` batch plan.
- When data quality, coverage, currency, production readiness, review status, blockers, post-seed backlog, or readiness changes, update `docs/DATA_QUALITY.md`, `docs/COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md`, `docs/DATA_CURRENCY.md`, `docs/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`, `docs/REVIEW_PROCESS.md`, and `docs/POST_SEED_BACKLOG.md`.
- When release build output, manifest fields, artifact names/formats, checksums, publication steps, or GitHub release process changes, update `docs/GENERATED_ARTIFACTS.md`, `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`, `schemas/release-manifest.schema.json`, and coordinate any pinned release changes in `datasets-api/dataset-releases.json` and website dataset metadata.

## Local Skill Selection

Repo-local skills live in `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. When a task
matches a skill below, read that `SKILL.md` before editing. Prefer the most
specific skill that covers the task, and combine skills only when the work spans
multiple areas.

Data-only edits to canonical JSON usually do not need a local skill unless they
also change validation rules, import behavior, reports, or release automation.
Schema and script changes should use the relevant skill before editing.

Use these local skills as follows:

- `nodejs-backend-patterns`: use when adding or changing Node scripts that behave like backend services, API clients, import pipelines, release publishers, or long-running automation with error handling and external integrations.
- `nodejs-best-practices`: use when making general Node.js architecture decisions, changing async control flow, handling files/processes, improving security, or choosing between implementation patterns in scripts.
- `zod`: use when defining or refactoring schemas, validators, `safeParse` flows, inferred types, or validation error handling for university records and fixtures.
